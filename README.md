Raycast laser renderer and point-plotter for VRChat.

## Overview
ðŸš§ This project is functional but in early stages with additional features planned. ðŸš§

VRC Raycast Laser is a single configurable UdonSharp behaviour that can be used to raycast a visual line-rendered laser with optional reflective properties and point-plotting for collision-detection objects.

It is intended to be efficient and relatively simple to use without the need for any additional editor scripts or dependencies outside of UdonSharp. All configuration can be done within the Unity Inspector window without the need for any programming, Udon, or SDK knowledge. That said, the source code is cleanly-organized and commented in the hopes of also being a good learning tool.

### Requirements
Errors regarding functions not being exposed likely mean you need an updated version of the SDK or UdonSharp.
- [VRChat Worlds SDK3](https://vrchat.com/home/download) (Tested: v2021.11.8)
- [UdonSharp](https://github.com/MerlinVR/UdonSharp) (Tested: v0.20.3)

### Recommended
Other useful VRChat world-creation tools that I will always recommend.
- [World Creator Assistant](https://github.com/Varneon/WorldCreatorAssistant) (SDK & Package Management)
- [CyanEmu](https://github.com/CyanLaser/CyanEmu) (Unity-Window Testing)
- [Udon Platform Hook](https://github.com/Superbstingray/UdonPlayerPlatformHook) (Moving-Platform Functionality)

### Setup
Make sure you have already imported the VRChat Worlds SDK and UdonSharp into your project.
- Download the latest [Unity Package](https://github.com/Pokeyi/VRC-Raycast-Laser/releases) and import it into your project.
- A pre-configured example prefab is included that you can drop into your scene if you like.
- Create and select an empty game object and add the P_RaycastLaser behaviour via the Unity Inspector window or 'Component > Pokeyi.VRChat > P.VRC Raycast Laser' toolbar menu.
- Click the 'Convert to UdonBehaviour' button if prompted.
- If a line-renderer component is not already on your game object, one will be added automatically. You can adjust the laser's visual properties here. (See: [Unity Docs](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-LineRenderer.html))
- Configure the rest of the behaviour's properties in the Inspector window as you see fit. Each of these is explained in detail further below.

## Features
The main features of the Raycast Laser.
- Raycast Properties - General settings pertaining to the raycast function.
- Collision Objects - Optional references to game objects that can be plotted to laser endpoint and midpoint for collision detection.
- Reflective Properties - If and how the laser can reflect off of other game objects.

All of the following properties have hover-tooltips in the Unity Inspector window.

### Raycast Properties
General settings pertaining to the raycast function.
- Max Distance - Maximum distance the laser will be rendered when nothing has been hit. I recommend a value of at least 500 to avoid some odd Unity behaviour.

### Collision Objects
If you want players or objects to be effected by your laser, you can add game objects here to be plotted along the laser's path.
- Laser Target - Object to plot at laser endpoint.
- Laser Midpoint - Object to plot at laser midpoint.

### Reflective Properties
If and how the laser can reflect off of other game objects.
- Can Reflect - Toggle ability to bounce on reflective surfaces.
- Reflect Name Contains - Check for partial object name designating a reflective surfaces.

### Use Case Examples
Despite the name you could use this for things other than lasers, and I plan to add more functionality for these.
- Other general forms of weapon targeting without the line renderer.
